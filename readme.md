Learn to code in Python, one bite at a time.

## Who is TastyPy for?
There are many types of programmers. While some people write code for their day job, many people program for pure fun, using code as a medium to create personal apps, games, music, or visual art. 

No matter who you are or what you want to do with your soon to be amazing programming skills, this tutorial was written for you. You don‚Äôt need advanced mathematics or a computer science degree to get started making cool projects. All you need is persistence and curiosity. With these traits, you can learn to code!

## Why is TastyPy different?
I have read many programming tutorials, and helped mentor several people learning to code. I paid close attention to the questions and misunderstandings that many people have even after completing a programming tutorial. This tutorial is thoughtfully written to help you learn valuable skills that developers usually learn with years of experience. In particular, you will learn to truly evaluate code in the way that the computer does, and intuitively understand how to put the building blocks of any programming language together to make something unique.
