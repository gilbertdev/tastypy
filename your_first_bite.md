# Fundamental Concepts

I can't wait to teach you how to program in Python! But first, it's helpful to understand a few fundamental concepts. What is a program, anyways? What is a programming language? What kind of programming language is Python, and how is it different from other programming languages?

## What is programming? What is a program?

It's really simple to understand what programming is. Computers only do exactly what they're told to do. Programming is thinking about what you really want a computer to do for you and writing clear, step-by-step instructions - the program - for the computer to accomplish the task.

## What is a programming language?

A programming language is what you use to give the computer instructions in a way it can understand. You may be wondering why we can't just give the computer instructions in English, or a different commonly spoken language. Let's look at an example and see why. Say you were programming a video game and told your computer: "Make the main character give a bath to the dog wearing a pink shirt." Should the computer look for a dog wearing a pink shirt, which the main character will then bathe? Or should the main character give the dog a bath while she wears a pink shirt? Unlike language humans use to communicate with each other, there is no ambiguity in the evaluation of a programming language, which has special rules not found in spoken languages.
